/**
 * The BreakIteratorFilter is used to modify the behavior of a BreakIterator
 *  by constructing a new BreakIterator which suppresses certain segment boundaries.
 *  See  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-general.html#Segmentation_Exceptions .
 *  For example, a typical English Sentence Break Iterator would break on the space
 *  in the string "Mr. Smith" (resulting in two segments),
 *  but with "Mr." as an exception, a filtered break iterator
 *  would consider the string "Mr. Smith" to be a single segment.
 *  
 * <p><b>Note:</b> An instance of {@link BreakIterator} returned by this builder
 * class currently does not support following operations in this technology preview
 * version:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link BreakIterator#next(int) next(int n)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link BreakIterator#previous() previous()}</li>
 *   <li>{@link BreakIterator#following(int) following(int offset)}</li>
 *   <li>{@link BreakIterator#preceding(int) preceding(int offset)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * When one of above methods is called, {@link UnsupportedOperationException} will be
 * thrown.
