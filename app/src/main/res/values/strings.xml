    <p>Fit Notifications is a third party application that allows you to send notifications from any of the apps installed on your phone to your compatible Fitbit device.
       In order to properly setup this application, please follow the provided instructions.</p>
    <p>The source code for this app is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/abhijitvalluri/fitnotifications\">Github (abhijitvalluri/fitnotifications)</a>, with contributions from other developers apart from Smart Dinosaurs Entertainment.</p>
	<p>Please note that neither \'Fit Notifications\' nor \'Smart Dinosaurs Entertainment\' is affiliated with Fitbit, Inc. in anyway.</p>
	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
	<p>Fitbit is a registered trademark and service mark of Fitbit, Inc.
       \'Fit Notifications\' is designed for use with the Fitbit platform. This application
       is not put out by Fitbit, and Fitbit does not service or warrant the functionality of this application.</p>
    ]]></string>
    <string name="instructions_text"><![CDATA[
    <p>To properly set up this application, please follow the instructions below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enable notification access to this application by clicking the \'Enable Notification Access\' button on the main screen.</li><br/>
        <li>In the Fitbit app, go into your device settings by clicking the device icon*.</li><br/>
        <li>Select \'Text Notifications\' or \'Call and Text Notifications\' under \'General\'.</li><br/>
        <li>Select \'Text Notifications\' under \'Settings\'.</li><br/>
        <li>Choose \'Fit Notifications\'. Sync your Fitbit device within the Fitbit app.</li>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> Do not choose \'Fit Notifications\' for \'Call Notifications\' or \'Calendar Notifications\' in the Fitbit app! Doing so will cause this app to not work!</p>

        <li>In the \'Fit Notifications\' app, press the \'Setup Apps\' button on the main screen. Then,
            choose the apps whose notifications you would like to be sent to your compatible Fitbit device.</li><br/>
        <li>Click the \'Turn on\' button at the bottom of the main screen when you want to start the notification
            service provided by this app. Once the service is running, the button says \'Turn off\' to stop the service.
            Click the \'Turn off\' button to stop the service. You must keep the Fitbit app from Fitbit, Inc.
            installed at all times and pair your Fitbit device to the phone for this to work. Enjoy!</li><br />
        <li><b>NOTE:</b> If you use a device running Android 6.0 or above and you enable \"Do Not Disturb\" mode, also
            called silent mode, then please follow the additional instructions below.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style=\"font-size:70%;\">* You must have a compatible Fitbit device, such as Fitbit Alta, Blaze or Surge.</p>
    <p>Future updates will further refine the feature set of this app! Please provide feedback on Google Play if
       there are any issues and if you like this app, kindly provide or update your review!</p>

    <h3>Enabling notifications when using \"Do Not Disturb\" mode</h3>
    <p>Due to the new \"Do Not Disturb\" mode in Android 6.0, if you use this mode (also called silent mode) then you
    will not receive notifications on your Fitbit device as Android disables notification forwarding. To avoid
    this issue manually, you have to change the notifications priority for Fit Notifications app.</p>

    <p>To do so, go to \"Settings>Apps>Fit Notifications\". Note that this menu may be at a slightly different location on
    your phone. Then, choose \"Notifications\" and enable \"Treat as priority\". Note that if your phone is running Android
    7.0 (Nougat) or newer version, then the option is renamed to  \"Override Do Not Disturb\". Enable this option.
    Then, when you use silent mode, enable \"Priority Only\". Doing so will allow you to get notifications via the app on
    your Fitbit device, but it will not make any notification sound on the phone as this app doesn\'t cause notification
    sounds or vibrations anyway.</p>

    <h3>Demo</h3>
    <p>Once you finish the setup process, press the \'Test Notification\' button on the main screen to send a test
    notification to your Fibit. You should then see a notification in the status bar from this app,
    while at the same time you should have received a sample notification on your Fitbit. Then, you have confirmed
    that the application is working correctly! Issues? Please contact us!</p>

    <string name="faqs_text"><![CDATA[
    <p><b>Q. Is my Fitbit device supported?</b></p>
    <p>This app can only work with Fitbit Alta, Blaze and Surge, i.e. those devices where you can set a text notification.
       Unfortunately, Fitbit, Inc. has recently changed the behavior for 3rd party call notifications on Charge and Charge HR.
       Hence those devices are not compatible with this app. Fitbit, Inc. may modify the behavior of text notifications at any
       time for the compatible devices. This is not in our control.</p>
    <p><b>Q. Will this app ever stop working as advertised?</b></p>
    <p>If Fitbit, Inc. decides to change the behavior of text notifications from 3rd party apps such as this, then unfortunately
       \'Fit Notifications\' may stop working. We will try to update the app in case of such issues. Please report such issues to us.</p>
    <p><b>Q. I am not getting any notifications on my Fitbit device. Why?</b></p>
    <p>Please ensure that your Fitbit device is one of the supported devices. Also, ensure that you have the official Fitbit app from
       Fitbit, Inc. Make sure that you followed all the instructions, including enabling notification access to \'Fitbit Notifications\'.
       Also, ensure that you can sync to your Fitbit device by enabling Bluetooth (location services should also be enabled on newer Android devices).</p>
    <p><b>Q. I still cannot get notifications! Why?</b></p>
    <p>Make sure you have enabled the notification feature on your Fitbit device. Additionally, ensure that the \'Fit Notifications\'
       service is running by pressing \'Start Service\' button below. This service MAY be stopped by Android on occasion. Do not use task
       killers as they can stop the service needed by this app to function. Finally, you can press the demo notification button below to
       test the functionality while you troubleshoot the problem.</p>
    <p>Other reasons as to why the app is not working include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>low battery on your Fitbit device: the Fitbit app may disable Notifications if your Fitbit device has low battery.</li>
        <li>Your Fitbit device may require a reboot to enable notifications, due to errors. Refer to the Fitbit website to find out how to reboot your device.</li>
        <li>You may need to reselect \'Fit Notifications\' as described in Step 5 in the instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Q. Can this app function if I use task killers on my phone?</b></p>
    <p>Please note that task killers may interfere with the proper functioning of this app. It is recommended that you disable task
       killers or at least allow them to keep the \'Fit Notifications\' service running.</p>
    <p><b>Q. Why am I not getting notifications from a particular app on my phone?</b></p>
    <p>Make sure that you have selected the app for which you want to see notifications on your compatible Fitbit device - refer to
        step 6 of the instructions. If you still have issues, and followed the instructions correctly, then please contact us via
       email to inform us the name of the application (including Google Play Store link) for which you are missing notifications.
       We will attempt to resolve this issue in an update.</p>

        <li>Improve transliteration quality for Polish and Lithuanian.<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Add option to send feedback on transliterations in the side navigation bar.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recent new features: New per app settings!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now filter notifications, discard empty notifications, and set a schedule for when notifications are forwarded.<br /><br /></li>

<br /> #
<br /> #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
<br /> #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
<br /> #  that the provisions of Section 3 (\"NO WARRANTY\") will ALWAYS appear
<br /> #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially

<br /> #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
<br /> #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
<br /> #
<br /> #  NO WARRANTY
<br /> #
<br /> #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
<br /> #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
<br /> #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
<br /> #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
<br /> #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term \"warranty\" used herein
<br /> #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
<br /> #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
<br /> #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
<br /> #  any right of any third party.
<br /> #
<br /> #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
<br /> #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
<br /> #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
<br /> #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
<br /> #
<br /> #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
<br /> #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
<br /> #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
<br /> #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
<br /> #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
<br /> #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
<br /> #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
<br /> #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
<br /> #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
<br /> #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
<br /> #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
<br /> #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
<br /> #  \"use\" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
<br /> #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
<br /> #  production of secondary products from the program.
<br /> #
<br /> #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
<br /> #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
<br /> #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
<br /> #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
<br /> #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
<br /> #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
<br /> #  above as far as the program is concerned.

5. Time Zone Database
<br /><br />
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
<br /><br />
 # 7.  Database Ownership
<br /> #
<br /> #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
<br /> #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
<br /> #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
<br /> #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
<br /> #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
<br /> #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
<br /> #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
<br /> #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
<br /> #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
<br /> #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
<br /> #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
<br /> #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
<br /> #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.</p>
