    <p>Fit Notifications is a third party application that allows you to send notifications from any of the apps installed on your phone to your compatible Fitbit device.
       In order to properly setup this application, please follow the provided instructions. Please note that this app will not work if the Fitbit app\'s notifications feature
       is not compatible with your phone.</p>

    ]]></string>
    <string name="instructions_text"><![CDATA[
    <p>To properly set up this application, please follow the instructions below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Enable notification access to this application by clicking the \'Enable Notification Access\' button on the main screen.</li><br/>
        <li>In the Fitbit app, go into your device settings by clicking the device icon*.</li><br/>
        <li>Select \'Text Notifications\' or \'Call and Text Notifications\' under \'General\'.</li><br/>
        <li>Select \'Text Notifications\' under \'Settings\'.</li><br/>
        <li>Choose \'Fit Notifications\'. Sync your Fitbit device within the Fitbit app.</li>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> Do not choose \'Fit Notifications\' for \'Call Notifications\' or \'Calendar Notifications\' in the Fitbit app! Doing so will cause this app to not work!</p>

        <li>In the \'Fit Notifications\' app, press the \'Setup Apps\' button on the main screen. Then,
            choose the apps whose notifications you would like to be sent to your compatible Fitbit device.</li><br/>
        <li>Click the \'Turn on\' button at the bottom of the main screen when you want to start the notification
            service provided by this app. Once the service is running, the button says \'Turn off\' to stop the service.
            Click the \'Turn off\' button to stop the service. You must keep the Fitbit app from Fitbit, Inc.
            installed at all times and pair your Fitbit device to the phone for this to work. Enjoy!</li><br />
        <li><b>NOTE:</b> If you use a device running Android 6.0 or above and you enable \"Do Not Disturb\" mode, also
            called silent mode, then please follow the additional instructions below.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style=\"font-size:70%;\">* You must have a compatible Fitbit device, such as Fitbit Alta, Alta HR, Charge 2, Blaze or Surge.</p>
    <p>Future updates will further refine the feature set of this app! Please provide feedback on Google Play if
       there are any issues and if you like this app, kindly provide or update your review!</p>

    <h3>Enabling notifications when using \"Do Not Disturb\" mode</h3>
    <p>Due to the new \"Do Not Disturb\" mode in Android 6.0, if you use this mode (also called silent mode) then you
    will not receive notifications on your Fitbit device as Android disables notification forwarding. To avoid
    this issue manually, you have to change the notifications priority for Fit Notifications app.</p>

    <p>To do so, go to \"Settings>Apps>Fit Notifications\". Note that this menu may be at a slightly different location on
    your phone. Then, choose \"Notifications\" and enable \"Treat as priority\". Note that if your phone is running Android
    7.0 (Nougat) or newer version, then the option is renamed to  \"Override Do Not Disturb\". Enable this option.
    Then, when you use silent mode, enable \"Priority Only\". Doing so will allow you to get notifications via the app on
    your Fitbit device, but it will not make any notification sound on the phone as this app doesn\'t cause notification
    sounds or vibrations anyway.</p>

    <h3>Demo</h3>
    <p>Once you finish the setup process, press the \'Test Notification\' button on the main screen to send a test
    notification to your Fibit. You should then see a notification in the status bar from this app,
    while at the same time you should have received a sample notification on your Fitbit. Then, you have confirmed
    that the application is working correctly! Issues? Please contact us!</p>

    <!-- FAQ #2.1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. What is the placeholder notification and why is it important?</b></p>
    <p>The placeholder notification is crucial for the proper functioning of this app. For example, if you setup
       this app to forward notifications from your email app to your Fitbit device, then whenever you receive
       an email notification, this app creates a corresponding \"Placeholder notification\" which contains
       the relevant info from your email notification. It is this placeholder notification that is then sent to your
       Fitbit device, and you see the info contained in your email notification on your Fitbit device.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> If your Fitbit device allows you to dismiss the notification on the watch, then the placeholder
       notification will be dismissed on your phone as well. Similarly, if you dismiss the placeholder notification
       on your phone either manually, or by using the \"Dismiss placeholder notification\" feature from this
       app\'s settings, then the notification will get dismissed from your Fitbit device as well. So, please keep this
       in mind if you enable this setting in the app, as it can cause the notifications to be dismissed automatically
       after a delay on your Fitbit device as well!</p>


    <!-- FAQ #2.2 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. Why is my Fitbit device not vibrating when it receives a notification?</b></p>
    <p>Please be aware that your Fitbit device may actually be receiving notifications, but may not be
       alerting you because it is not vibrating. This can happen in silent mode or do not disturb mode,
       or may occur on devices running Android 10 and above, because of the way Fit Notifications app creates a new,
       silent notification (placeholder notification).</p>

    <p>To fix this problem, you can go to the \"Notifications\" settings for your Fitbit device in the
       official Fitbit app. In the Notifications settings, please enable the \"Always Vibrate\" option.</p>


    <!-- FAQ #3 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. I am not getting any notifications on my Fitbit device! How can I fix it?</b></p>
    <p>Please ensure that your Fitbit device is one of the supported devices, as described above. Also, make sure that your phone is compatible
       with the \"Call & Text Notifications\" feature of the Fitbit app by <a href=\"https://www.fitbit.com/devices\">checking on the Fitbit website.</a>
       If your phone is not listed on the Fitbit website, or does not have the \"Call & Text Notifications\" feature listed as compatible, then this
       app may not work.</p>

    <p>If your phone is compatible, then verify that you followed all the instructions in the setup, including enabling notification access to \"Fitbit Notifications\".
       Also, ensure that you can sync to your Fitbit device by enabling Bluetooth (location services should also be enabled on newer Android devices).</p>


    <!-- FAQ #4 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. I still cannot get notifications!! Why?</b></p>
    <p>Make sure you have turned on your Fitbit device\'s notification setting. You can learn how to do this and many other helpful tips to troubleshoot
       issues by visiting <a href=\"https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1610\">this help page on the Fitbit website.</a></p>

    <p>Some other suggestions for troubleshooting:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the \"Fit Notifications\" service is running by pressing \"Turn on\" button on the home page. This service MAY get stopped
            by Android on occasion. Do not use task killers as they may accidentally stop this service and cause issues.</li>
        <li>You can click on the \"Test Notification\" button on the home page to send a test notification and troubleshoot the functionality of this app.</li>
        <li><b>Low battery on your Fitbit device:</b> Please charge your device as the Fitbit app may disable Notifications if your Fitbit device has low battery.</li>
        <li>Your Fitbit device may require a restart to enable notifications, due to errors. Please read this
            <a href=\"https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1186\">help page</a> to learn how to restart your device.</li>
        <li>You may need to go through the interactive setup process again and select \"Fit Notifications\" as your text notification app in Fitbit, and sync your device again.</li>
    </ul>


    <!-- FAQ #5 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. Are there any known issues with this app?</b></p>
    <p>Some users have experienced issues receiving notifications when they enable the \"Dismiss placeholder notification\"
       setting within this app. If you are experiencing issues with notifications, please try increasing the \"Dismiss\" delay,
       or try disabling this setting completely. Also, refer to the above FAQ on \"placeholder notifications\" for more
       details about how some Fitbit devices deal with notifications being dismissed on the phone.</p>


    <!-- FAQ #6 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. Why am I not getting notifications from a particular app on my phone?</b></p>
    <p>Go to the \"Setup Apps\" screen from the home page, and make sure that you have selected the app for which you want to
       see notifications. Click on the settings icon next to the checkbox to access the app specific settings, and check that
       all settings are correct, including the schedule. These app specific settings can cause some notifications to not appear,
       so it is important to verify them.</p>

    <p>If you still have issues, and followed the instructions correctly, then please contact us via
       email to inform us the name of the application (including Google Play Store link) for which you are missing notifications.
       We will follow up to troubleshoot the issue with you.</p>


    <!-- FAQ #7 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
    <p><b>Q. Will this app ever stop working as advertised?</b></p>
    <p>If Fitbit, Inc. decides to change the behavior of text notifications from 3rd party apps such as this, then unfortunately
       \"Fit Notifications\" may stop working. We will try to update the app in case of such issues, but we cannot guarantee that this
       app will work forever. Please report such issues to us.</p>
    <p><b>Q. Can this app function if I use task killers on my phone?</b></p>
    <p>Please note that task killers may interfere with the proper functioning of this app. It is recommended that you disable task
       killers or at least allow them to keep the \"Fit Notifications\" service running.</p>

5. Time Zone Database
<br /><br />
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.
<br /><br />
 # 7.  Database Ownership
<br /> #
<br /> #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
<br /> #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
<br /> #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
<br /> #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
<br /> #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
<br /> #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
<br /> #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
<br /> #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
<br /> #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
<br /> #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
<br /> #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
<br /> #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
<br /> #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.</p>
